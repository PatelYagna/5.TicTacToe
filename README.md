# 5.TicTacToe
This is a two player TicTacToe game. It is mostly created through functions, but there is a bit of hardcoding. 


The reason this project came so late was due to ACT testing, and other resposiblities which I had to prioritize first. Another reason is due to the difficulty of the project at hand. It was quite hard to make the game into a more dynamic functionable game. 

I didn't discover any new libraries, however, I did discover the importance of writing dynamic functions and utilizng built in python functions. I first completed a version of TicTacToe that was purely hard codded. I wrote countless if statements to choose a winner, and other things. However, to improvise and learn I wrote dynamic functions. Writing these functions led to an immense amount of trial and error. Nevertheless, I was able to complete the project. Additonally, I could imrpove this code, by making a function to switch the players, however, I was not able to complete that portion.

From this point on I do think I will start to write more and more dynamic funtionable code, and keep improving older projects. Furthermore, I wish to learn a new coding tactic I discovered called Object Oriented Programming or OOP. This was introduced to me by my friends, and cousins. From what I can tell this tactic will make the code more focused, easy to understand, and far more effective.
